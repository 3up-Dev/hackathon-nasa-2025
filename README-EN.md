# Planting Future ðŸŒ±

## About the Project

**Planting Future** is an educational serious game that simulates sustainable agricultural production in Brazil using real-time NASA climate data. The game allows students and professionals to learn about sustainable agriculture, climate adaptation, and responsible use of natural resources through an interactive experience based on scientific data.

### Development with AI

> **AI Usage Statement**: This project was developed 100% with Artificial Intelligence assistance. All software architecture, business logic, API integration, user interface, and documentation were created through human-AI collaboration. The human team was responsible for requirements definition, educational design, scientific validation of NASA data, and quality supervision.

**Important**: Climate data is provided directly by NASA and INMET APIs without any AI modification. Artificial Intelligence was used exclusively for:
- Code architecture and development (React/TypeScript frontend, Supabase backend, Edge Functions)
- Game logic (viability calculation, production engine, task system)
- User interface and experience (React components, responsive design, animations)
- Secure integration with external APIs (NASA POWER, NASA FIRMS, INMET)
- Technical and educational documentation

**Human Supervision**: All implementation was reviewed and validated by humans in the following areas:
- System architecture and technical decisions
- User experience design (UX/UI)
- Educational and pedagogical design
- Scientific data integrity validation
- Security and privacy testing

**Media**: This project **DOES NOT** use AI-generated images, audio, or video. All icons are standard Unicode emojis and graphics are rendered by JavaScript libraries (Recharts).
